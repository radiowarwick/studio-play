# RAW Studio Play V2

RAW Studio Play is a rework of [Digiplay Legacy](https://github.com/radiowarwick/digiplay_legacy). This is written using React and makes use of the Digiplay API to provide a system which is highly portable to improve the ease of running full studio outside broadcasts.

The rewrite makes use of the WebAudio API to provide distinct outputs to soundcard channels allowing the isolation of the players and audiowall.

## Installation/Setup

To run your own development environment do the following.
```
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/radiowarwick/studio-play.git

$ cd studio-play

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Create and modify your own local environment file
$ cp .env.example .env.development.local

# Edit the file to add your own API key
# Or add your local digiplay references

# Run the server
$ npm start
```

# Create React App default README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
